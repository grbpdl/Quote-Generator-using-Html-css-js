Your task is to create a simple quote generator app using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app should fulfill the following requirements:

- Add a dropdown button or radio button to toggle between categories. For example, selecting a “science” category should only show “science” quotes. And there should be a minimum of two categories.
- Implement "Next" and "Previous" buttons that allow users to navigate through the quotes in sequential order.
- Implement a "Random" button that shows random quotes from the selected categories.
- Add a switch to toggle between dark and light mode for the app's interface.
- Provide functionality to increase and decrease the font size of the displayed quotes.
- Design the app that is mobile friendly.
- The app should be built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the use of any external frameworks.
- Backend services and databases should not be used for this project.
- Host the app on Netlify and make the source code available on a GitHub repository.
